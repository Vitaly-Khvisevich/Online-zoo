                  and larger in size. In all gorillas, males develop silver coloration along their backs as they mature. The species is diurnal, 
                  which means they are active during the day, and of all the great apes, gorillas are the most terrestrial. This means that they 
                  primarily live on the ground, although they do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla">occasionally climb trees</a> to feed and nest. They are also able to stand on two legs 
                  for short periods of time.</span>

                  <p class="characteristics-part1 new-string"><span class="information__text">Gorillas are the largest of all primates and 
                  reach physical maturity between 12 and 15 years of age. Males can be between 350 and 450 pounds, almost twice as much 
                  as females, weighing in between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla">150</a> and 
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla">250</a> pounds. Males stand between 5.5 to 6 feet tall. 
                  Females are a bit smaller, standing between 4’7” to 4’11”. The males’ heads are large and pointed due to the sagittal 
                  crest that forms the back of the top of the head. This crest serves as the foundation for attachment of a great number 
                  of jaw muscle fibers, which allows for the chewing power needed to process tough vegetation.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="characteristics-part2 new-string"><span class="information__text">The vision and perception of western lowland 
                    gorillas is similar to that of humans. Gorillas have a prominent brow ridge, small, flat ears, and hear about the same 
                    as humans. The nose is broad, flat and fleshy. The wrinkles on a gorilla’s nose, known as a noseprint, are like human 
                    fingerprints, and every individual’s noseprint is unique. Researchers use these noseprints as identification markers 
                    in their studies, both in zoological settings and in the wild.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="characteristics-part3 new-string"><span class="information__text">Gorillas have 32 teeth, including sharp 
                    canines used for defense and breaking through vegetation. Their molars have complicated patterns of cups and ridges 
                    that facilitate chewing of tough plant fibers.</span>

                  <p class="characteristics-part4 new-string"><span class="information__text">Gorillas’ faces, hands, and feet are bare, 
                    but the rest of their bodies are covered with short, thin hair. Gorilla hands and feet are large, with leathery palms 
                    and soles, and broad, flat nails Their hands are very dexterous and can pick up small, delicate objects. Like their 
                    hands, their feet have opposable thumbs and toes. Like all apes, gorillas’ arms are longer than their legs—a feature 
                    that allows them to walk on all fours. They are called “knuckle-walkers,” meaning that they walk on the knuckles of 
                    their forelimbs and the soles of their hind limbs. This form of locomotion develops calluses on the knuckles, 
                    preserving the sensitivity of the fingertips necessary for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla">

                    are not normally aggressive to other animals unless provoked. However, if they are provoked, they can be dangerous. 
                    They can demonstrate aggression by charging towards perceived intruders. Typically, they will not actually hit the 
                    intruder, but rush past, turn and then charge again.</span>

                  <p class="lifestyle-part3 new-string"><span class="information__text">Infants have three distinct vocalizations; 
                    these are similar to the cries of a human baby. They will typically cry when hurt or frightened, resulting in 
                    an immediate response from the mother.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="lifestyle-part4 new-string"><span class="information__text">Dominant males also have a distinctive smell 
                    that they use to communicate with other troops and to maintain contact with their own troop. Perhaps the most 
                    recognizable behavior performed by gorillas is chest-beating. It is primarily done by male gorillas at the end 
                    of a display meant to intimidate intruding males or predators. The sound can be heard for long distances. 
                    Females will chest-beat infrequently; they will typically beat their hands against the insides of their thighs. 
                    Chest-beating can also indicate playful behavior, however, especially in the young. Young gorillas play much like 
                    humans do, playing tag and doing somersaults.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="lifestyle-part5 new-string"><span class="information__text">Western lowland gorillas live in family groups 
                    known as troops. These troops can consist of 5 to 30 individuals, although the average size is 11. The group is 
                    led by a dominant silverback male and contains several adult females and their young. The females will typically 
                    bond with the silverback, but not necessarily with each other. The silverback will remain dominant for as long as 
                    he can defeat competing males.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="lifestyle-part6 new-string"><span class="information__text">There are several younger, blackback males 
                    that remain in the group until they are capable of challenging the silverback. These young males are often 
                    driven out of the troop to live a solitary life or to live in a smaller group with other bachelors until they 
                    establish their own troops. If a dominant silverback is displaced, the new dominant male will typically kill 
                    the infants in the troop, sending the females prematurely into reproductive cycling. This increases the male’s 
                    chances of siring offspring, as his time as the dominant male is uncertain. As such, females consider a male’s 
                    ability to fight paramount to their offspring’s survival.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="lifestyle-part7 new-string"><span class="information__text">On maturing, females will also leave their 
                    natal group to join a lone male or another small group. This is vital to prevent inbreeding and to protect the 
                    gene pool.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="lifestyle-part8 new-string"><span class="information__text">Nesting typically occurs in the late 
                    afternoon, with the gorillas bedding down for the night at sundown. The females and their offspring will 
                    build nests of leaves and branches, while the dominant silverback will settle at the base of the tree, in 
                    order to protect his family. At Zoo Atlanta, while the gorillas are outside, their indoor areas are thoroughly 
                    cleaned; the walls and floors are scrubbed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla">
                      disinfectant.</a> The gorillas are offered hay in their indoor area at night and nest with this material, 
                      replicating natural behavior.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="lifestyle-part9 new-string"><span class="information__text">In a troop, the single silverback male will 
                    mate with the females, siring all the offspring of the troop. Females generally reach reproductive maturity 
                    between 7 and 8 years of age, with males reaching maturity later, around 10 years of age, due to competition. 
                    The potential breeding season is year-round and gestation typically takes 256 days, or about 8.5 months. Labor 
                    can last anywhere from one to 4 hours. Babies are usually born singly; twins are rare. Newborns weigh between 
                    3 and 5 pounds and are weaned around 2 to 3 years of age, but can be dependent on their mothers for up to 4 
                    years. The average interval between births for a female gorilla is four to six years.</span>

                  <p class="habitat-text new-string"><span class="information__text">Western lowland gorillas prefer the tall, 
                    lush tropical forest of west and central Africa. The herbs, shrubs and vines that make up its diet grow best 
                    where the open canopy allows plenty of light to reach the forest floor. These tropical forests also contain 
                    a much higher diversity of arboreal substrates and foods, in particular fruit, than mountainous habitats. 
                    Western lowland gorillas live primarily on the ground and build sleeping nests on the ground or in the trees 
                    for the night.</span>

                  <p class="diet-text new-string"><span class="information__text">Western lowland gorillas are primarily 
                    herbivorous, feeding on plant parts including seeds, leaves, stems, shoots, roots and flowers; however, 
                    they prefer fruit whenever it’s in season. Occasionally they will eat insects, such as termites or ants, 
                    as a supplement to their diet when they are readily available. Due to their dietary preferences, western 
                    lowland gorillas spend a lot of their time in and around trees, especially fruit trees. Even large males 
                    can sometimes be found up in the trees, but they are careful to stay near a main trunk or on larger 
                    branches that are able to support their weight. Younger, lighter gorillas may climb higher in trees, 
                    even swinging freely from branch to branch. Gorillas never completely strip vegetation from a single 
                    area; rather, the rapid regrowth of the vegetation they consume allows them to stay within a reasonable 
                    confined home range for extended periods of time.</span>

                  <p class="diet-text2 new-string"><span class="information__text">Here at Zoo, we provide a medley of
